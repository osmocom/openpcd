- code to control digital potentiometers via SPI [MM]
	- chip select not SPI CS

- idea: use comparator to determine voltage range, then reconfigure amplifier
	- later

- problem: capacitance of digital poti
	- idea 1: 
	- idea 2: logarithmic amplifier using transistor

- ADC driver
	- core [MM]
		- trigger function (we want to read all values ASAP)
		- callback function (once new values are available)
		- init function (initialize ADC)
	- USB integration [HW]
		- simple READ_ADC command
		- one reply packet with all ADC channels

- OS timer 
	- how often?

- 'load modulation' driver
	x set PA2/PA3 to binary 0..3 

x add IO definitions for
	- PLL INHIBIT			low
	- SPI_SS1_GAIN		
	- SPI_SS2_DATA_THRESHOLD
	- BOOTLDR

- sampled data continuous output into file / stdout
	- trigger sampling by raising/falling edge (configurable)
	- sample only one buffer

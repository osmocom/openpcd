- data that is needed from both app and dfu mode
- code that is needed from both app and dfu mode
	- function pointers
	- copy code to RAM in case of DFU switch
- data that is only needed in DFU mode
	- can be overwritten in case of reset-to-application
- data that is only needed in app mode
	- can be overwritten with DFU data in case of DFU switch
- code that is only needed in DFU mode
	- has to be copied to ram in case of DFU switch
- code that is only needed in app mode
	- can be read from flash, no action required


=> abandoned that complicated idea.  
now all DFU functions are __ramfunc's and thus always present.


interaction between app and dfu code:

- dfu_switch(void)
- dfu_status (can be put in accessor function, if required)
- dfu_cfg_descriptor
- dfu_dev_descriptor
- dfu_ep0_handler()


order of events at boot;

- start at reset vector in flash
	- AT91F_LowLevelInit()
- setup stack for each mode
- relocate 'data' of bootloader, including ramfunc/vectram
- clear 'bss' of bootloader
- call remap command
	- call usb initialization (irq, clock)
	- if keypress,
		- call dfu_main()
			- wait for ep0 / busreset interrupt
	- else call main()


memory layout:

0: lowlevel startup code
	Cstartup.o	0x00bc
	Cstartup_SAM7.o	0x0100
	dfufunc		0x1dcc
	dfustruct	0x0038

	text		text	0x0070
data		data	0x0000
bss		bss	0x000c

flash 	= text + data  (= 8k)
ram/rel	= data + bss (12 bytes)


If we drop the DFU-can-flash-DFU requirement, we can leave all DFU related code
in flash. no need for  any function to be permanently in RAM.  However, not
preventing this feature in some future version, we shouldn't do that.
